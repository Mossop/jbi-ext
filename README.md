# Jira Bugzilla Integration Extension

The Jira Bugzilla Integration automatically links Bugzilla bugs to Jira stories
and syncs changes made in Bugzilla to Jira.

This extension helps with the things the automated tool cannot, such as creating
bugs for Jira issues that already exist and automatically linking them.
