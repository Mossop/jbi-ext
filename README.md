# Jira Bugzilla Integration Extension

The Jira Bugzilla Integration automatically links Bugzilla bugs to Jira stories
and syncs changes made in Bugzilla to Jira.

This extension helps with the things the automated tool cannot, such as creating
bugs for Jira issues that already exist and automatically linking them.

Features:

* When viewing a Jira ticket that links to a Bugzilla bug an icon in the address bar provides a quick link there.
* When viewing a Bugzilla bug that links to a Jira ticket an icon in the address bar provides a quick link there.
* When viewing a Jira ticket in a known project with no bug link an icon in the address bar allows you to create a new linked bug.
